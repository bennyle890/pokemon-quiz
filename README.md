## Quiz Based on Pokemon!

In this repository is a quiz based on Pokemon facts from the show and game. It is timed for 75 seconds and you will be deducted 10 points/seconds based on incorrect answers. This was very difficult because I had issues deploying the website through GitHub, and I had to change the code last minute in order for it to deploy through Github. 

Attached is a photo of the first question
